# MOZART Low-level API

This repository contains (so far, the initial design of) the definition of [MOZART](https://mozart-robotics.eu/) low-level API, which is used for communication to the hardware. To contribute, make a fork, update `swagger.yaml`, open a pull request, and discuss changes with others. The API can be checked out [here](https://robofit.github.io/mozart-api-low/) (the page will be updated after merging a PR). For doing changes, [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) might be handy (also to validate the file). Discussion about intended changes, problems, and open questions can happen through issues.
